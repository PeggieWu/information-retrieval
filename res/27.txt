brief_title:Gene Therapy of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
brief_summary:Near 85% of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma are diagnosed with a locally advanced and/or metastatic unresectable tumor. In these patients chemotherapy (such as gemcitabine) is given as a palliative therapy. Aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility, tolerance and antitumor effect of repeated intratumoral injection of a gene therapy product (with antitumor and chemo sensitizing effects) combined with gemcitabine in patients with unresectable pancreatic carcinoma.
detailed_description:This is a gene therapy open non randomized phase I trial for advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. The protocol is based on the administration of increasing doses of a plasmid DNA pre-complexed to PEI (polyethylenimine - non-viral vector) that encodes two genes (somatostatin receptor subtype 2 named sst2 and deoxycitidine kinase :: uridylmonophosphate kinase named dck::umk) which exhibit complementary therapeutic effects. Both transgenes induce an antitumor bystander effect and render gemcitabine treatment more efficient. Intratumor injections of the gene therapy product (CYL-02) will be performed by transgastric or transduodenal route under endoscopic ultrasound guidance. Each injection will be followed standard gemcitabine IV administration every week (1000 mg/m2). Two intratumor injections of a same dose of CYL-02 will be administered at one month interval. Four increasing doses (125 µg, 250 µg, 500 µg and 1 mg) will be tested by group of 6 patients. The primary objectives are: evaluation of local pancreatic and general tolerance; the secondary objectives are: possible tumor volume regression, secondary respectability, evaluation of transgene biodistribution.
