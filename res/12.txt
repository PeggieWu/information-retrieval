brief_title:Study of Ataluren in ≥2 to <5 Year-Old Males With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
brief_summary:This is a Phase 2, multiple-dose, open-label study evaluating the safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ataluren in patients aged ≥2 to <5 years old with Duchenne muscular dystrophy caused by a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. The study includes a 4-week screening period, a 4-week study period, and a 48-week extension period for patients who complete the 4-week study period (52 weeks total treatment).

detailed_description:The invited population will be offered ultrasound investigation of their abdominal aorta. Further information regarding risk factors will be noted and measurement of ankle-brachial index will be measured/calculated. A further step in the future will be to sample blood with focus on different cytokines and genmediators.
