brief_summary:No agent is known to have efficacy in patients with incurable HNSCC that progressed with prior platin, 5-FU, cetuximab and taxane. Herein lies the unmet need to be addressed by this trial. Based on the preclinical and clinical data presented, the investigators propose that mitomycin C will have anti-tumor activity in these patients.

Herein lies the unmet need to be addressed by this trial. Based on the preclinical and clinical data presented, the investigators propose that mitomycin C will have anti-tumor activity in these patients.
detailed_description:Phase II Clinical Study From March 2008 to December 2010 Safety and efficacy of intratumoral injections of E10A to cisplatin and paclitaxel was evaluated a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical study in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.  136 eligible patients were recruited and randomly assigned. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma not suitable for operation or radiotherapy were randomly assigned to receive E10A plus chemotherapy every 21 for a maximum of six cycles or to receive chemotherapy only.  The primary end point was the objective response rate (RR), defined as the proportion of patients who had a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the target tumor lesion. The secondary end points were the objective disease control rate (DCR, or stable disease (SD) + PR + CR at the target tumor lesion), the overall RR, the overall DCR, OS, and progression-free survival (PFS).  The administration of E10A benefited some subgroups of patients. In the HNSCC patients, the objective RR was 36.5% (15/41) with E10A administration, exhibiting a trend of exceeding the rate of 20.0% (7/35) in the control group (P = 0.090; OR: 0.43), whereas the objective RR was 44.4% (12/27) versus 40.6% (13/32) in the NPC patients (P = 0.487; OR: 0.86). Patients who had previously received chemotherapy in the E10A group had a 44.8% (12/29) objective RR, whereas patients in the control group had only a 22.6% objective RR (7/31; P = 0.06, OR: 0.36). In contrast, patients without previous chemotherapy had a similar RR in both groups (34.3 versus 39.4%; P = 0.426, OR: 1.25).  The difference in the Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS favored chemotherapy plus E10A, which resulted in a 3.43-month improvement. With a median follow-up of 10.47 months, the median PFS was 3.60 months (interquartile range: 2.60-7.63) in the control group and 7.03 months (interquartile range: 3.27-13.73) in the E10A group. As The median PFS was 3.60 months (interquartile range: 2.60-7.63) in the control group and 7.03months (interquartile range: 3.27-13.73) in the E10A group.  The OS of the E10A group was relatively prolonged in different subgroups compared with the controls (e.g., 13.37 months versus 9.67 months in the HNSCC patients, 13.03 months versus 10.50 months in those who had received prior treatment; Figure 1), but these results did not translate into significantly superior survival.

The difference in the Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS favored chemotherapy plus E10A, which resulted in a 3.43-month improvement. With a median follow-up of 10.47 months, the median PFS was 3.60 months (interquartile range: 2.60-7.63) in the control group and 7.03 months (interquartile range: 3.27-13.73) in the E10A group. As The median PFS was 3.60 months (interquartile range: 2.60-7.63) in the control group and 7.03months (interquartile range: 3.27-13.73) in the E10A group.  The OS of the E10A group was relatively prolonged in different subgroups compared with the controls (e.g., 13.37 months versus 9.67 months in the HNSCC patients, 13.03 months versus 10.50 months in those who had received prior treatment; Figure 1), but these results did not translate into significantly superior survival.
