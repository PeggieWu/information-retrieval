brief_title:5-year Study to Track Clinical Application of DecisionDx-Melanoma Gene Expression Profile Assay Results
brief_summary:The INTEGRATE Registry Study follows patients with cutaneous melanoma who have had the DecisionDx-Melanoma gene expression assay performed. Data will be collected through review of medical records from clinical visits with physician.  The purpose is to document the clinical application of results obtained from the DecisionDx- Melanoma multi-gene assay and to track outcomes of patients for whom DecisionDx-Melanoma testing has been completed. Additionally the study will assess the health economic impact of DecisionDx-Melanoma testing as it relates to the Melanoma population.

detailed_description:The invited population will be offered ultrasound investigation of their abdominal aorta. Further information regarding risk factors will be noted and measurement of ankle-brachial index will be measured/calculated. A further step in the future will be to sample blood with focus on different cytokines and genmediators.
