brief_title:Factors Influencing the 3-Year Recurrence of Liver Carcinoma After Surgery
brief_summary:Objective:  1. To study the factors that influence the 3- year recurrence of liver carcinoma after surgery  2. To study the related factors affecting recurrence of liver carcinoma after surgery
detailed_description:Liver carcinoma including 80% Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 20% Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) becomes the leading causes of death in East and South-East Asia. Though hepatectomy is the treatment of choice for early stage cancer, the recurrence has been reported as 30%, 62% and 79% in 1st, 3rd and 5th year respectively. Chulabhorn hospital, a cancer institute established in 2011, has been performing a 3-years retrospective study on the influencing factors and its correlation to liver carcinoma after surgery.
